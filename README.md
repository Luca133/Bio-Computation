# Bio-Computation
This folder contains the code and supplementary report for the coursework assignment for the Biocomputation module for BEng Robotics.  
  
The aim of this assignment was to design a genetic algorithm using MATLAB which, when given a set of binary strings and the expected output as inputs, was able to classify them correctly.
